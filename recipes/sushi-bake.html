        <h2>Descriptions:</h2>
        <p class="description">This savory, satisfying sushi bake recipe is a local favorite in Hawaii. It's the only thing I make to take to parties anymore. 
            <br>Even at a smaller gathering, the baking dish is empty at the end of the night. Like most casseroles, this dish is very forgiving, 
            <br>so don't sweat it if you can't find an ingredient or aren't sure about the quantities.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>4 cups cooked short-grain rice</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons aji nori furikake (seasoned seaweed and sesame rice topping)</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package imitation crabmeat, shredded</li>
            <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 ounce tobiko (flying fish roe) (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 kamaboko (Japanese fish cake), sliced into matchsticks</li>
            <li>12 (2 ounce) packages seasoned Korean seaweed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak shiitake mushrooms in hot water until soft, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spread rice in the prepared pan; sprinkle furikake evenly over top.</li>
            <li>Drain mushrooms and squeeze out excess water. Mix mushrooms, imitation crabmeat, mayonnaise, sour cream, tobiko, and kamaboko together 
                <br>in a large bowl. Spread over furikake.</li>
            <li>Broil in the preheated oven until lightly browned on top, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and slice into 24 portions while in the 
                <br>baking dish.</li>
            <li>Spoon a generous mound from the baking dish onto a sheet of seaweed, wrap loosely, and consume immediately.</li>
        </ol>
